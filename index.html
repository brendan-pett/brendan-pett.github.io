<h1>Nerys: The Bullet Proof</h1>
<p>"The most valuable thing is information. Information can buy things that money simply cannot. Some information, in turn, can be bought with money. The incredibly clever invest in information while minimizing their losses, so good coin must be spent on agents who can retrieve information without sloppy mistakes, and care must be put into choosing targets that are especially vulnerable to ensure the highest chance of success. In order to identify vulnerabilities, one must be able to process data and perceive the intricate patterns that are created by people knowing people knowing people. ... </p>
  
<p>Information is easy to obtain or create, like so many products, when reduced to a small scale. However, what about the manufacture and marketing of a product to millions? Suddenly, the enormity of the task is about knowing and managing the right people, usually someone doing that exact same thing in their own network below yours. There is a great equalization, though, in that whether you are blessed with riches or an urchin on the street, you can obtain valuable information if you know where to look, so every caste creates workers and managers.</p>
  
<p>Information—the valuable kind—is either harvested by those overhearing it, or leaked by those who have it. In either case, money can extract it. Everything is reduced to monetary cost. The urchin on the street overheard a drunk bourgeois saying something they shouldn’t say in public, and he’ll tell you for 20 coin. Monetary cost. The baker’s wife knows something her friend overheard about a politician, but she wants to know if her husband has been unfaithful, so an operation must be planned and executed to spy on him without his knowledge. In order to arrange for the operation, the agents’ handler decides that, instead of coin, they want a way to contact a cogni who handles accounting for the steam plant. That cogni is keen to give you a line of contact, but only if you can convince her manager to reduce her workload because what little social life she has is suffering. Her manager will reduce her hours, but only if he can find someone to work under her as a supplemental worker. You know someone, but they already have a position somewhere else. You manage to convince them to work for the cogni’s manager, but only if the pay is better (and it is) in addition to a sizable bonus, which the manager refuses to pay, so you pay it out of pocket. Monetary cost."</p>
